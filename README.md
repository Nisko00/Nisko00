Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Nikos, I'm from Greece, and I'm a student at the Hellenic Open University, pursuing my first degree in Computer Science.

I love systems and how they work. I also enjoy programming, especially in C.

Currently, I work at a company as a computer technician, where my role involves quality assurance for prebuilt computers.

- Iâ€™m currently learning C and Python programming.
- Iâ€™m interested in learning more about system programming
